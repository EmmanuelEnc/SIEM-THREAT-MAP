# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Honeypot with Geolocation & Sentinel Integration

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a virtual honeypot deployed in [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), designed to detect and visualize unauthorized login attempts in real time. The honeypot runs on a Windows virtual machine and captures failed RDP login attempts using Windows Event Viewer (Event ID 4625).  

A Data Collection Rule (DCR) in [Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/) is used to automatically pull security logs from the virtual machine into a Log Analytics Workspace. To enrich the data with geolocation, a custom spreadsheet containing IP address mappings to country, city, latitude, and longitude is uploaded into Sentinel as a Watchlist.  

Using [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/), the failed login attempts are joined with the watchlist data, enabling geographic insights. These are visualized in a Sentinel Workbook through an interactive map displaying real-time attack origins.  
This project demonstrates the use of native Azure tools for cloud security, log collection, and threat visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Notes
**Note:** This project is hosted in a personal Microsoft Azure environment and is not designed to be run locally. However, it can be replicated using the instructions and PowerShell script provided.

### To Replicate This Project:
1. **Deploy a Windows VM in Azure and enable RDP access**

2. **Modify VM‚Äôs Network Security Group to allow public RDP and disable the firewall inside the VM**

3. **Ensure Event ID 4625 (failed login attempts) is being logged**

7. **Create a Workbook and use KQL to join login data with watchlist records**
```kql
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent;
WindowsEvents | where EventID == 4625
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)
| summarize FailureCount = count() by IpAddress, latitude, longitude, cityname, countryname
| project FailureCount, AttackerIp = IpAddress, latitude, longitude, city = cityname, country = countryname,
friendly_location = strcat(cityname, " (", countryname, ")");
```

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Enable alerts and automated playbooks to respond to brute-force activity  
- Expand the watchlist with additional intelligence sources or IP reputation data  
- Add honeypots with other protocols (e.g., SSH, FTP) to diversify threat monitoring  
- Integrate with Power BI or a web dashboard for advanced analytics  
- Experiment with anomaly detection using Azure ML or built-in Sentinel rules
